		<p style="font-size:20px">My father's name is Sanjeeva Kumar, and he is the greatest inspiration in my life. He is a hardworking, honest, and disciplined man who has always prioritized our family above his own needs. He works with complete dedication and never complains, no matter how challenging the situation may be. His strength and positive attitude inspire me every single day.

Despite his busy schedule, he always ensures he spends time with us and supports me in everything I do. Whether it's my studies, career choices, or personal struggles, he is always there with wise advice and encouragement. I admire his calm nature and the respectful way he treats others, no matter who they are.

He strongly believes in the power of education and constantly motivates me to do my best. His life lessons have taught me the value of hard work, honesty, and never giving up. Because of him, I strive to become a responsible and successful person.

Sanjeeva Kumar is not just my father but also my role model, guide, and best friend. I feel proud and lucky to be his son, and I hope to make him proud with everything I achieve in life.
