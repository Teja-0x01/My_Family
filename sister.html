	   <p style="font-size:20px">My sister’s name is Mounika, and she is one of the most important people in my life. She is loving, caring, and always brings positive energy to our home. As a sister, she is supportive, understanding, and always stands by me in both good and difficult times. No matter what the situation is, I know I can always count on her.

Mounika is not just a sister but also a friend and guide. She is intelligent, confident, and always ready to help others. I admire her for her ability to handle responsibilities with maturity and for the way she balances her studies, work, and personal life. She always encourages me to stay focused, work hard, and believe in myself.

We share a special bond filled with laughter, little fights, and unforgettable memories. Whether we’re talking about life or sharing jokes, time spent with her always feels comforting. Her presence brings happiness and peace to my life.

I’m proud to have a sister like Mounika who inspires me every day. I truly respect her and wish to follow her good qualities. She is a blessing to our family, and I feel lucky to have her as my sister.</p>
