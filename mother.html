	    <p style="font-size:20px">My mother's name is Rajya Lakshmi, and she is the heart of our family. She is a kind, caring, and strong woman who has always been there for me in every step of my life. Her love and sacrifices cannot be measured. From early morning till late at night, she works tirelessly to take care of the family, often putting our needs above her own.

Rajya Lakshmi is not only a wonderful mother but also my first teacher and best friend. She has taught me important values like kindness, respect, honesty, and patience. Her words always carry warmth and wisdom, and her presence brings peace to our home. Whenever I feel low or confused, her support gives me strength and clarity.

She encourages me to study well and follow my dreams, and she always celebrates even my small achievements with great joy. I admire her for managing everything so beautifullyâ€”whether it's taking care of the house, supporting my father, or guiding me in life.

I feel truly blessed to have Rajya Lakshmi as my mother. Her unconditional love and support mean everything to me. I hope to make her proud by becoming the kind of person she has always dreamed I would be.</p>
