		<p style="font-size:20px">My name is Dhramateja Teja, and I am currently in the final year of my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, which has driven me to explore areas like software development, data science, and artificial intelligence. My final year project focuses on building a Weather Prediction System using Deep Learning, where I have worked with LSTM and KNN models to analyze and forecast weather patterns. Through this project, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Python, machine learning, and data preprocessing.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing cricket and specialize as a bowler. Cricket has taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to perform under pressure—skills that I carry into my academic and professional life.

I am a fast learner with a curious mindset. I believe in continuous improvement and always look for opportunities to grow, whether through projects, internships, or self-learning. I am also preparing for technical interviews and have been sharpening my skills in Python, data structures, and SQL.

Looking ahead, I aim to build a career in software development or data science where I can apply my technical knowledge and contribute meaningfully to real-world solutions.</p>
